# Forecastro
A simple weather forecasting app showing temperature,humidity, wind speed information.
In this project, I have made use of RapidAPI along with HTML,CSS and Javascript to build the Front-End.

* RapidAPI provides us with all the right tools we need for API testing. It provides an intuitive UI that we can use to debug, test, and interact with HTTP APIs. This accelerates the API delivery and improves the user experience. The user will have to enter the name of the place where he/she wants to know the weather report.
